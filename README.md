I am a computer science student who has explored both front-end and back-end development through various projects and learning experiences. I have worked with React.js and Node.js to build web applications and have experience using MySQL for database management. While I am still developing my technical skills, I enjoy exploring different technologies and continuously improving through hands-on projects. While still growing as a developer, I enjoy learning new technologies and working on "real-world challenges".

Beyond coding, I’ve actively participated in global exchange programs:

🌏 U.S. Public High School Exchange Student - 1 year
  – Adapted to a new environment, improved English communication, and gained valuable international experience.
🇩🇪 AI COSS Program @ Technische Hochschule Ulm (Ulm University of Applied Sciences, Germany) - 1 month
  – Studied AI, machine learning, and deep learning. Successfully collaborated on a team project and completed a capstone assignment.
🌎 Global Exchange Program (Nagoya, Japan) 
  – Worked with international university students, delivered presentations in English, and developed cross-cultural collaboration skills.

I’m passionate about leveraging technology to solve global challenges and eager to grow as a developer in diverse, international environments. 🚀 Let’s connect! 💡
